val excludeAspectRatiosCropRequest = CropRequest.Manuel(
    sourceUri = uri,     
    destinationUri = destinationUri,
    requestCode = RC_CROP_IMAGE,
    excludedAspectRatios = arrayListOf(AspectRatio.ASPECT_FREE)
)
```

If you want to give specific theme as accent color.
```kotlin
val themeCropRequest = CropRequest.Manuel(
    sourceUri = uri,
    destinationUri = destinationUri,
    requestCode = RC_CROP_IMAGE,
